# CVFS
This project is a custom implementation of a Virtual File System (VFS) that simulates the core functionality of the Linux file system. It is built entirely in C, with its own custom shell (Commands) to interact with the Virtual Environment. This project provides a Practical Understanding of system calls, file handling, and OS internals.
